# Hospital-Readmissions-Analysis
This project investigates patterns in hospital readmissions using a dataset of diabetic patient encounters over ten years. The analysis provides insight into factors affecting readmission rates and identifies patient groups most at risk.


## 📌 Project Goals

This exploratory data analysis aims to:
1. Determine the most common primary diagnosis by age group
2. Analyze the relationship between prior inpatient visits and readmission likelihood
3. Examine disparities in readmission frequency across different races
4. Characterize patients with frequent readmissions


## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008), containing over 100,000 records of diabetic patients from 130 US hospitals over a 10-year period.

### Key Features:
- Patient demographics (age, race, gender)
- Medical specialty and diagnosis codes
- Number of prior hospital visits
- Readmission status
- Medication data and lab procedures

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas` – data loading and transformation
- `numpy` – numerical operations
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – data visualization
